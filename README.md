# WeSnipe
#### The best python-based discord vanity sniper, which uses my own custom-built python-library to easily snipe vanitys.

# Usage
```py
from wesnipe import Client

client = Client(
  id=123, # server ID
  token="" # acc token or bot tbh.
)

base = client.snipe("beliefs") # vanity
print(base)
```

# Information
> * Because __wesnipe__ is not officially on Pypi, you will need to manually add the library to your code.
> * Created in 3 & 1/2 minutes.
